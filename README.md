![alt text](tool.png)

**HackTheLan** is an all-in-one automated offensive toolkit designed for **pentesters and red teamers** who need to perform **on-site LAN/WLAN attacks and network reconnaissance** efficiently. Built mainly with **Python and Scapy**, this tool brings together multiple attack and discovery capabilities in a single interface. Also this tool include SilentBridge that allow you to bypass NAC controls 802.1x to access to the Network.

## What It Does

- **LAN Discovery:** Identify hosts and network devices using tools like `netdiscover`, `nmap`, or `nxc`.
- **Bypass the NAC / 802.1x EAP:** Use differents attacks that incorporate SilentBridge tool to bypass 802.1x NAC controls
- **WLAN Attacks:** Capture WPA2 handshakes using `airodump-ng`, deauth packets with Scapy.
- **MAC/IP Spoofing:** Bypass NAC restrictions and impersonate devices.
- **ARP/DHCP Spoofing:** Hijack network traffic and perform MiTM.
- **IPv6 Recon:** Detect IPv6 hosts and services.
- **NTLM Hash Capture:** Redirect Windows authentication to steal NetNTLM hashes.
- **Automation First:** No more switching tools ‚Äî HackTheLan wraps it all in a single flow.
